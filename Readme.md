# TCGA tests

This repo just tracks some R based data analysis of TCGA data, based on tutorials from [Chatomics1](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/post/pca-tcga/) .
Nothing fancy and very novel just playing a bit around.
The report is generated and published [here](explore1.md)

It contains already as well the Dockerfile and json to work with all dependencies in a Vscode dev container.
